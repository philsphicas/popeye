# Include "regular" gcc settings
include toolchains/gcc/make.incl


# Now override where necessary

# Compiler options
# ================

# Disable LTO on macOS - it can cause linker issues

CCOPTIM := $(filter-out -flto,$(CCOPTIM))
LDOPTIM := $(filter-out -flto,$(LDOPTIM))
endif

# abort with a descriptive message if undefined behavior is detected

# Compiler selection
# ==================

# Compiler for creating executables on host
CCHOST=clang

# Linker for creating executables on host

# Compiler for creating executables on target
